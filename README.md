## Simple JavaFX Ball Game, Mar. 2023
- My first "bigger" assignment
- Some improvements could be:
-   to have multiple classes rather than just 1 large one (such as a Ball and Game GUI class)
-   the Ball class would be useful as its characteristics are inheritable, and would reduce repeats in the code
